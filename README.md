Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build and train a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning and computer vision. It includes 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
